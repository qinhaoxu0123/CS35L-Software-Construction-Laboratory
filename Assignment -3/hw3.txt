\f0\fs24 \cf0 Q1:\
Brady removed \'93case_long_ios_time_style:\'94 because there was a goto statement that went to this label. No, no need to remove this line, because the goto statement was removed, thus that label would never be referenced.\
\
Q2:\
Problem:\
.Date format is very different in some countries \
.inconsistencies in other programs that display dates in different format.\
\
Q3:\
use wget to get the landline.py\
command: python randline.py /dev/null\
output: IndexError: list index out of range \
The reason for this error is because the randline.py  script attempts to access elements of the file using arguments in brackets, and no elements at that index \
\
Q4\
output:\
File \'93./randline.py, line 65\
except I0Error as (errno, strerror):\
                             ^\
SyntaxError : invalid syntax\
\
python3 has a different error syntax.\
python2 had automatic tuple unpacking  but in python3 the tuple parameter unpacking was removed which causes the error syntax to be different.\
